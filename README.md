A super simple theme that is just [@discord], but dark.

Yep, [@discord] has a solarised-like dark theme already, but this is a pure dark theme. Let's look at a side-by-side of the two.

![JustDark](https://github.com/LeonskiDev/just-dark/blob/master/assets/just-dark.png?raw=true)

*"Why not use one of the other million dark themes?"* Simpliy because they always add that one extra feature. This is just [@discord], actually dark, and no extras included.

## Installing
You'll need to install [BetterDiscord] to be able to use the theme. You'll also need to make sure that the *"Normalize Classes"* setting is on.

Once you've done this you can either clone this repo or download it as a zip. Then move the `JustDark.theme.css` to the [BetterDiscord] theme folder which can be opened in the *"Themes"* section.

Then you're ready to use the theme by going to the *"Themes"* section and enabling it. Your all done!
